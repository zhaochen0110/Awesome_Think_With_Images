## Introduction

Welcome to Awesome-Think-With-Images! The field of multimodal AI is undergoing a fundamental evolution, moving beyond static visual perception towards a new paradigm where vision becomes a **dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace**. This repository is the first comprehensive resource that systematically curates the pivotal research enabling this shift.

We structure this collection along a trajectory of increasing cognitive autonomy, as detailed in our survey. This journey unfolds across three key stages:

1.  **Stage 1: Tool-Driven Visual Exploration** ‚Äî Models as "Commanders" orchestrating external visual tools.
2.  **Stage 2: Programmatic Visual Manipulation** ‚Äî Models as "Visual Programmers" creating bespoke analyses.
3.  **Stage 3: Intrinsic Visual Imagination** ‚Äî Models as "Visual Thinkers" generating internal mental imagery.

  <p><em>The paradigm shift from ‚ÄúThinking about Images‚Äù to ‚ÄúThinking with Images‚Äù, an evolution that transforms vision from a static input into a dynamic and manipulable cognitive workspace.</em></p>

As detailed in our survey, this paradigm shift unlocks three key capabilities: **Dynamic Perceptual Exploration**, **Structured Visual Reasoning**, and **Goal-Oriented Generative Planning**. This collection is for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts eager to explore the forefront of AI that can truly see, reason, and imagine.
